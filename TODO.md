# Mineprint TODO

- Libraries of nodes, metadata + code templates? Json? What's the format for templates?
    - Split templates into a linked list, seperated by places in which code can be inserted.
    - Fold into a string when exporting to source
- Loader agnostic - same source can compile to NeoForge / Fabric.
- Import and preview models from BlockBench?
- Terraria support?
